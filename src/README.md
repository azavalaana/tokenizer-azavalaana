Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Introduction:

 The objective of the first lab project is to build a tokenizer that maintains a history. 
 Tokenizing is the process of dividing a string into tokens by some delimeter (e.g. the string librarys split() function). 
 Consider tokenizing the string “The cake is a lie!” using the space character. 
 This would result in: [“The”, “cake”, “is”, “a”, “lie!”].
 
 This directory contains source code for a program "tokenizer." 

# Compiling & Running the Code
To compile & execute the user interface program
While being inside this directory write on the terminal 
> make
This will compile the program, So to run it you'll write
> ./test 
(the compiling name is test since right now we are on the second milestone and it is still in a testing phase)
